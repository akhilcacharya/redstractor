# Redstractor

Extract text corpora from subreddits. Written in Go, using the my fork of [geddit](https://www.github.com/akhilcacharya/geddit) library, which originated from [jzelinskie](https://github.com/jzelinskie).


## Usage

    $ redstractor -sub={Subreddit Name} -user={Username} -pass={Password}

The text corpus will then be saved in the same directory under the name of the subreddit.
